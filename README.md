# Owlbear Rodeo Extensions Guide for D&D

This is the GitHub repo for the [Owlbear Rodeo Extensions Guide for D&D](https://obr-extensions-guide.onrender.com). 

I welcome and encourage feedback and contributions. I think it would be great if the Owlbear Rodeo community really fleshed out this tutorial page to make extensions as accessible as possible for newcomers.

## Contributions

I am looking for contributions that:

* Add an article for a category of extensions
* Add a tutorial for an extension or category of extensions
* Provide translations

You can contribute by forking the repo and contributing directly or contact me in the [Owlbear Rodeo Discord](https://discord.gg/ARf8RTTUKQ) where you can find me @Seamus.

### Article Contributions

Please write articles in markdown with similar formatting to [this article](https://github.com/SeamusFinlayson/OBR-Extensions-Guide/blob/main/DiceReview.md?plain=1). I can take care of formatting it into an html page. Be sure to add yourself as the author and provide me with any social media sites you would like to have linked on that page.

I am happy to accept original articles in languages other than English.

### Tutorial Contributions

If you have video tutorials for an extension or category add an issue with a link to the tutorial. Ideally have the video posted on youtube.

### Translation Contributions

Contact me for translation contributions. Please write translated articles in markdown format similar to [this article](https://github.com/SeamusFinlayson/OBR-Extensions-Guide/blob/main/DiceReview.md?plain=1). I am also interested in translating the home page, if you want to provide a translation for the home page you can edit a copy of the index.html file and I'll get it linked in the site.
