            <p><em>Written by Seamus Finlayson on Dec. 23, 2023</em></p>
            <p>Owlbear Rodeo has great dice extensions that work well with D&amp;D.</p>
            <h3 id="dice">Dice</h3>
            <p>First we’ll look at Dice, the first-party extension designed by the Owlbear Rodeo developers. It provides
                several beautiful sets of physics based dice, has a simple interface, and allows you to show your roll
                to other players or keep them secret.</p>

            <p>But, for some, it might be a little too simple. The dice selection is limited and it doesn&#39;t save the
                result of previous rolls, which brings us to...</p>
            <h3 id="rumble-">Rumble!</h3>
            <p>Rumble! is a chat window that lets you send messages to other members of your group. It&#39;s more than
                just messaging though, it also has physics based dice, well implemented safety cards, and Discord
                integration. Because of its chat based nature, all the rolls you make are saved, however you cannot make
                hidden rolls. Rumble! lets you customize the dice with many different dice patterns and the ability to
                change the dice colour to any RGB value you want.</p>

            <h3 id="witchdice">Witchdice</h3>
            <p>Witchdice provides some more advanced dice rolling options but lacks physics based dice. Witchdice
                provides discord integration, shares rolls with players, has roll result history, and also has a clock
                tool if your game uses those.</p>

            <h3 id="dddice">dddice</h3>
            <p>dddice is a physics based multiplayer dice roller. A tool that can be used external to Owlbear Rodeo. It
                connects to its own dice marketplace and has extra tools for streamers. dddice does require an account
                to take full advantage of all of its features.</p>
            <img src="https://cdn.dddice.com/owlbear/store.png" alt="image">
            <h3 id="hp-tracker">HP Tracker</h3>
            <p>HP Tracker fully integrates dddice without need for the standalone extension. It allows to roll directly
                from statblocks inside HP Tracker, as well as defining a set of customizable Buttons and a quick-roll
                button. It also allows to sync dice with external site supported by dddice like DnD Beyond or dddice
                itself. No dddice account is needed to use HP Trackers dice-roller integration only if you want access
                to your premium themes.</p>
