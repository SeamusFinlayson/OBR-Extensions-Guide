## Dice Extensions Review

*Written by Seamus Finlayson on Dec. 23, 2023*

Owlbear Rodeo has 4 great dice extensions that work well with D&D.

### Dice

First weâ€™ll look at Dice, the first-party extension designed by the Owlbear Rodeo developers. It provides several beautiful sets of physics based dice, has a simple interface, and allows you to show your roll to other players or keep them secret.

But, for some, it might be a little too simple. The dice selection is quite limited and it doesn't save the result of previous rolls, which brings us to...

### Rumble!

Rumble! is a chat window that lets you send messages to other members of your group. It's more than just messaging though, it also has physics based dice, well implemented safety cards, and Discord integration.

Because of its chat based nature, all the rolls you make are saved, though you cannot make hidden rolls. Rumble! lets you customize the dice with many different dice patterns and the ability to change the dice colour to any RGB value you want.

### Witchdice

Witchdice provides some more advanced dice rolling options but lacks physics based dice.

Witchdice provides discord integration, shares rolls with players, has roll result history, and also has a clock tool if your game uses those.

### dddice

dddice is a physics based multiplayer dice roller. A tool that can be used external to Owlbear Rodeo. It connects to its own dice marketplace and has extra tools for streamers.
